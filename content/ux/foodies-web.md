## Overview

This case study focuses on designing a responsive web app for the existing "Foodies" food delivery mobile app, as described in this <a href="/ux/foodies/">case study</a>.

It targets customers who prefer devices with large screen sizes (laptops, tablets or desktops) to mobile devices.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h4><i class="bi bi-exclamation-circle-fill"></i> The Problem</h4>
    <p>
      Some people prefer devices with large screen sizes for online activities.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h4><i class="bi bi-star-fill"></i> The Goal</h4>
    <p>Design a food delivery responsive web app that allows users to easily order healthy meals and get it delivered at their doorstep.</p>

## User research
I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users' problems. The primary user group were people who preferred devices with large screen sizes for online activities.

This user group confirmed initial assumptions about potential customers. Research also revealed that apart from screen size, the availability of a mobile device was also a factor limiting users from using the mobile app. 

<br>

### Pain points

<h4><i class="bi bi-universal-access"></i> Accessibility</h4>
<p>Either the target users don't have access to a mobile device or have difficulties using one.</p>

      Pratyush is a Doctor with a busy and demanding schedule at a hospital in Sambalpur. 
      He cares a lot about being available to his patients and often takes appointments at the 
      last minute. He lives alone and mostly orders food online. Text-heavy and unresponsive apps 
      make it difficult for him to find and order the right food.

## Starting the design

### Wireframes

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center mb-3">
  <img src="/assets/images/foodies_desktop/wireframes.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Foodies image"
       style="max-width: 1000px; width: 100%;">
</div>

<br>

### Low-fidelity prototype
Using the completed set of digital wireframes, I created a low-fidelity prototype. The primary user flow was to select a restaurant and order food. This prototype was used in a usability study.

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center mb-3">
  <img src="/assets/images/foodies_desktop/lofi.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Foodies image"
       style="max-width: 1000px; width: 100%;">
</div>

{{< squiggle >}}

## Usability study
I used the high-fidelity prototype for the usability study and it revealed aspects of the designs that needed refining. 

### Findings
- Menu tab was missing from the restaurant page.
- Important links: Help, Contact and About were missing from the design.

## Refining the design
I added the Menu tab and the missing links.

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center mb-3">
  <img src="/assets/images/foodies_desktop/restaurant.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Foodies image"
       style="max-width: 1000px; width: 100%;">
</div>

## High fidelity prototype
The final high-fidelity prototype presented cleaner user flows for ordering food and checkout. It also met user needs for payment on delivery option.

</div>

## Accessibility considerations
- Provided access to users who are visually impaired through adding alt text to images for screen readers.
- Used icons to help make navigation easier.
- Used detailed imagery for food items to help all users better understand the designs.
