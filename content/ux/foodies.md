## Overview

Foodies is a food delivery mobile app. It strives to deliver a wide range of food items from various restaurants. It targets customers who lack the time to prepare meal and helps them order food online and get it at their doorstep.

## User research
I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users I’m 
designing for and their needs. A primary user group identified through research 
was working adults who don’t have time to cook meals. 

This user group confirmed initial assumptions about potential customers, but research 
also revealed that time was not the only factor limiting users from cooking at home. 
Other user problems included obligations, interests, or challenges that make it 
difficult to get groceries for cooking or go to restaurants in-person.

### Pain points

<div class="row">

    <h4><i class="bi bi-clock-fill"></i> Time</h4>
    <p>Working adults are too busy to spend time on meal prep.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h4><i class="bi bi-universal-access"></i> Accessibility</h4>
    <p>Platforms for ordering food are not equipped with assistive technologies.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h4><i class="bi bi-diagram-3-fill"></i> Information Architecture</h4>
    <p>Text-heavy menus in apps are often difficult to read and order from.</p>

      Pratyush is a Doctor with a busy and demanding schedule at a hospital in Sambalpur. 
      He cares a lot about being available to his patients and often takes appointments at the 
      last minute. He lives alone and mostly orders food online. Text-heavy and unresponsive apps 
      make it difficult for him to find and order the right food.

### User journey map

Mapping Pratyush’s user journey revealed how helpful it would be for users to have access to a food delivery app.

## Starting the design

### Paper wireframes

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center mb-3">
  <img src="/assets/images/foodies/paper_wireframes.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Foodies image"
       style="max-width: 1000px; width: 100%;">
</div>

Taking the time to draft iterations of each screen of the app on paper ensured that the elements that made it to digital wireframes would be well-suited to address user pain points. For the home screen, I prioritized a quick and easy ordering process to help users save time. 

<br>

### Digital wireframes

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center mb-3">
  <img src="/assets/images/foodies/digital_wireframe.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Foodies image"
       style="max-width: 650px; width: 100%;">
</div>

As the initial design phase continued, I made sure to base screen designs on feedback and findings from  the user research.

<br>

### Low-fidelity prototype
Using the completed set of digital wireframes, I created a low-fidelity prototype. The primary user flow I connected was selecting a restaurant and ordering food, so the prototype could be used in a usability study. 

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center mb-3">
  <img src="/assets/images/foodies/lofi.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Foodies image"
       style="max-width: 1000px; width: 100%;">
</div>

## Usability study
I conducted two rounds of usability studies. Findings from the first study helped guide the designs from wireframes to mockups. The second study used a low-fidelity prototype and revealed what aspects of the mockups needed refining. 

### Round 1 findings
- Users want to be able to edit quantity of food items from the review page as well

### Round 2 findings
- Sign In link was missing from the Sign Up page

{{< squiggle >}}

## Refining the design
Early designs didn’t have a way to edit quantity from the Review page, but after the usability studies, I updated the Review order page to allow Quantity adjustments.

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center mb-3">
  <img src="/assets/images/foodies/review_before_after.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Foodies image"
       style="max-width: 650px; width: 100%;">
</div>

The second usability study revealed that the Sign Up page didn’t have a Sign In link. Added it.

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center mb-3">
  <img src="/assets/images/foodies/signup_before_after.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Foodies image"
       style="max-width: 650px; width: 100%;">
</div>

## High fidelity prototype
The final high-fidelity prototype presented cleaner user flows for ordering food and checkout. It also met user needs for payment on delivery option.

</div>

## Accessibility considerations
- Provided access to users who are visually impaired through adding alt text to images for screen readers.
- Used icons to help make navigation easier.
- Used detailed imagery for food items to help all users better understand the designs.
