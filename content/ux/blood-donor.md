## Overview

"Blood Donor" is a mobile app designed to help people donate or find blood donors. It targets people who have difficulties finding a blood donor.

## User research
I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users' problems. The primary user group were people who had faced a situation where they needed a blood donor.

### Pain points

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h4><i class="bi bi-binoculars-fill"></i> Finding donors</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Posting on multiple social platforms is tiring, consumes a lot of time and doesn't give a positive response.</li>
      <li>Unable to find donors who are nearby or available.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h4><i class="bi bi-patch-question-fill"></i> Availability</h4>
    <p>Unaware of the availability of blood, travelling to different blood banks is a pain.</p>
  </div>

## Starting the design

### Wireframes

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center mb-3">
  <img src="/assets/images/blood_donor/wireframes.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Blood donor app wireframe"
       style="max-width: 1200px; width: 100%;">
</div>

<br>

### Low-fidelity prototype
Using the completed set of digital wireframes, I created a low-fidelity prototype. The primary user flow was to find a blood donor. This prototype was used in a usability study. 

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center mb-3">
  <img src="/assets/images/blood_donor/lofi.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Blood donor app low fidelity prototype image"
       style="max-width: 1200px; width: 100%;">
</div>

## Usability study
I conducted two rounds of usability studies. Findings from the first study helped guide the designs from wireframes to mockups. The second study used a high-fidelity prototype and revealed what aspects of the mockups needed refining. 

### Round 1 findings
The design didn't include a sign-in process for recipients to help find a blood donor fast. Because of this, users couldn't track their requests after closing the app.

### Round 2 findings
The "blood group" and "state" appeared to be text input fields which should have been dropdown menus.

## Refining the design
I added a simple phone number and OTP sign-in process to help users track their requests.

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center mb-3">
  <img src="/assets/images/blood_donor/login.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Foodies image"
       style="max-width: 820px; width: 100%;">
</div>

I added icons to make "blood group" and "state" appear like dropdown menus.

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center mb-3">
  <img src="/assets/images/blood_donor/form.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Foodies image"
       style="max-width: 820px; width: 100%;">
</div>

## High fidelity prototype
The final high-fidelity prototype presented cleaner user flows for finding a blood donor.
